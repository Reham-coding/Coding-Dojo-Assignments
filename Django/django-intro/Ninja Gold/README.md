# Guidelines
- Refer to the wireframe below.
- Have the four forms appear when the user goes to http://localhost:8000
- Use a hidden input tag in each form to pass the relevant location to the server
- Have /process_money determine how much gold the user should have
- For now, save the activity log in session
